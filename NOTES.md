We are going to use Netlify Large Media for media like images but keep Imgix in mind as an alternative, as an image loader - looks easier to deal with than Cloudinary.

The advantage to Netlify Large Media, I think, will be to have control over the images distributed to all users, as opposed to centralized under one account (mine) in order to minimize costs
